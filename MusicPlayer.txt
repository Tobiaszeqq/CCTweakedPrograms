How to self-host
The ComputerCraft program connects to a web server to download the music files. This server is hosted with Firebase Cloud Functions.

Download this repository to your computer into a folder.
Sign up for Firebase and make a new project at https://firebase.google.com/. A billing account is required even for the free plan. The limits of the free plan should be plenty for most people.
Install Node.js version 20 from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
In your terminal, run npm install -g firebase-tools to install Firebase.
In your terminal, navigate inside the project folder. Run firebase login and follow the steps.
Run firebase init functions and follow the steps. Choose JavaScript. Don't choose to overwrite the functions/index.js or functions/package.json files when it asks you. Install the dependencies when prompted.
Run cd functions to go inside the functions directory and then run npm install to install more dependencies.
Run cd .. to go back and then run firebase deploy to deploy your new Cloud Function.
After the deployment is complete it will give you the Function URL. Copy that URL into the first line of music.lua.
